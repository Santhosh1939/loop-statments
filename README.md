"iterative statements" and "loop statements" are essentially the same thing; 
they both refer to code structures that allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times, 
making them both valuable tools for automating repetitive tasks and processing data efficiently.
Looping statements in Python facilitate the repeated execution of a block of code. 
Python supports two primary types of loops: for loops and while loops.
