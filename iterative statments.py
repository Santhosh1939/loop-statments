# Coding Exercise:
# Exercise 1: Sum of Squares
# Write a Python program that calculates and prints the sum of the squares of
# numbers from 1 to 5 using a 
# for loop.
 
# for a in [1,2,3,4,5]:
#     print(f"sum of squares {a} is {a*a}")

# output:
# sum of squares 1 is 1
# sum of squares 2 is 4
# sum of squares 3 is 9
# sum of squares 4 is 16
# sum of squares 5 is 25




# Exercise 2: Countdown
# Write a Python program that uses a 
# while loop to print a countdown from 5 to 1.
# i=0
# while i in range(5,1):
#                print(f"count down {i}")

# Exercise 3: Multiplication Table with Nested For Loop
# Write a Python program to print the multiplication table for a user-specified
# number using a nested for loop.

# number=int(input("Enter a number:"))
# for i in range(1,11):
#     print(f"{number} x {i} = {number*i}")

# output:
# Enter a number:20
# 20 x 1 = 20
# 20 x 2 = 40
# 20 x 3 = 60
# 20 x 4 = 80
# 20 x 5 = 100
# 20 x 6 = 120
# 20 x 7 = 140
# 20 x 8 = 160
# 20 x 9 = 180
# 20 x 10 = 200


# Exercise 4:
# Write a Python program that uses a "for" loop to find the sum of all even
# numbers between 0 and 10 (inclusive).

# n=0
# for i in range(0,11,2):
#     n += i
#     print(f"sum of even numbers 0 to {i} : {n}")

# output:
# sum of even numbers 0 to 0 : 0
# sum of even numbers 0 to 2 : 2
# sum of even numbers 0 to 4 : 6
# sum of even numbers 0 to 6 : 12
# sum of even numbers 0 to 8 : 20
# sum of even numbers 0 to 10 : 30


# Exercise 5:
# Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to a given number
# a=int(input("enter a number : "))
# i=int(input("enter another number :"))
# for i in range(0,999,1):
#     a =+ i
#     print(f"sum of all numbers {a+i}")


# Exercise 6:
# Display numbers from a list using loop
# for i in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]:
#     print(i)

# output:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
# 7






# Exercise 7:
# Display numbers from -10 to -1 using for loop

# for i in range(-10,0,1):
#     print(i)

# Exercise 8:
# Write a program to display all prime numbers within a range
# n=int(input("enter a number :"))
# for i in range(0,15):
#     if i == n%1==1 and n%n==1:
#         print(i)
